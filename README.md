# GemmaWithDspy

* This notebook contains my work on implementation of RAG using Gemma-2b instruction model with Dspy and chromaDB as vector database.
* The notebook is executed in Kaggle notebook environment & the accelerator used is GPU T4 x 2.
* The dataset used in this notebook is a book called `Aurelien-Geron-Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-Tensorflow_-Concepts-Tools-and-Techniques-to-Build-Intelligent-Systems-OReilly-Media-2019`
* [Request access to the Gemma model family](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it) on Hugging Face to be able to use Gemma via DSPy.

  Note: _This notebook is inspired from the great works of many developers such as [https://www.kaggle.com/iamleonie] & [https://www.kaggle.com/usman49]_
